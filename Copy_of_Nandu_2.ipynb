Since his hiatus from the series, Taylor was a director for several big budget Hollywood films, including \\'\\'Thor: The Dark World\\'\\' and \\'\\'Terminator Genisys\\'\\'. In an interview with \\'\\'Entertainment Weekly\\'\\', Taylor spoke about the differences between his earlier stint with the series, and his return for the show\\'s seventh season, saying he was previously told to avoid using green screen, and thus special effects, due to the budgetary constraints that the series had in its earlier seasons. However, with \"Beyond the Wall\", he was able to fully utilize visual effects to create the large environment, dragons and armies due to the increased budget.

Taylor had expected to film the sequence entirely in Iceland, but quickly realized that it was not feasible due to the amount of production that was required. In filming the wight polar bear attack, Taylor noted that the bear was designed by the New Zealand-based Weta Digital, which previously worked on \\'\\'The Lord of the Rings\\'\\' trilogy.

He also said that the sword he was using weighed approximately three times more than a normal sword. Though the actors were dressed warmly for the scenes beyond the Wall, their suits contained a \"tube system through which cold water can be circulated between shots using a portable pump to keep them from getting overheated,\" due to the actual warmth of filming on a fake set in Northern Ireland.

Going into filming, one of McLachlan\\'s most desired effects was the amount of smoke on the battlefield, saying \"we wanted to block the sun out so the shots would have some consistency. And I knew the fire and smoke would be incredibly beautiful.\"White smoke was used towards the beginning of filming, but as the battle went on, McLachlan decided to switch to black smoke, which was accomplished through burning diesel oil. This caused the crew to be required to wear masks and goggles, and raised concern for HBO\\'s safety officer, who eventually prohibited further use of the black smoke due to health and safety concerns.

They have two sons — another Aegon and Viserys.  Alicent's son Aegon also marries his sister Helaena, and they produce three young children: twins Jaehaerys and Jaehaera, and baby Maelor.  The Hightowers, meanwhile, remain the biggest supporters of Alicent's Aegon, and her father Otto becomes Hand of the King for many years.  The Hightowers increasingly whisper that according to the Great Council at the death of Jaehaerys I, a male heir should come ahead of a female one, and thus Aegon should inherit throne ahead of Rhaenyra - even though Otto himself once ignored that precedent of the council, when he wanted young Rhaenyra to be heir ahead of her uncle Daemon (a hypocrisy not lost on the Blacks).  Rhaenyra's followers also counter that had the Great Council followed standard inheritance, Aemond's daughter Rhaenys should still have inherited ahead of Baelon's son Viserys, in which cause Rhaenyra's sons with Laenor would rank ahead of Aegon anyway (which only encourages the Greens to double-down on the accusation that they are really bastards).\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 6}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '20440d656dde64d4bc0519946a7780b8'}>,\n",

He is undefeated in battle. Viserys Targaryen conspired with Magister Illyrio to marry Daenerys to Drogo in order to get his support in an invasion of Westeros. Though Daenerys was initially unhappy with the arrangement, Drogo proves to be a sensitive husband and lover despite his fearsome behavior with his men. After a failed poisoning attempt on a pregnant Daenerys' life, he promises to invade Westeros to reclaim the Seven Kingdoms as a gift to his unborn son, but is wounded by one of his men, Mago, before he could begin the invasion. The wound festers, owing to ‘treatment’ from a resentful witch enlisted as healer by Daenerys, and Drogo becomes so sick that he is unable to ride his horse, a sign of weakness to the Dothraki. Most of his khalasar abandons him, but Daenerys unknowingly sacrifices their unborn child for a spell to revive him. The spell works, but leaves him in a catatonic state. Daenerys smothers him out of pity, and the flames of his funeral pyre ultimately hatch her dragon eggs.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 4}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'bc1ccea339e1e757380d7d853395781a'}>,\n",

The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, with Djawadi describing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by saying \"The boys I recorded completely separate.

In the story, Tyrion uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the prejudice he has received all of his life, even from his own family, especially his father and sister. Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit and self-indulgence. As the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to decay, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are at holding everything together.

In contrast to Tywin and Cersei, Jaime has great affection for Tyrion and treats him with kindness, respect, friendship and love.
